For the past 3 months I have been fortunate enough to work as an intern at Red Hat.

Whilst working with the company, I was assigned to the Security Response Team, this division deals with a middleware product called JBoss. Over the duration of my placement I worked on delivering a solution that would enable the Security Response Team to locate and keep track of security related issues. The objective of the project involved developing an automated software that is able to intelligently analyze security relevant posts that are located within the JBoss Community Forums.

By undertaking this project I believe that I have provided the Red Hat SRT with an efficient way to filter through copious amounts of information to receive only what is relevant. Ultimately, I also believe that this is beneficial for the Security Response Team as they can use this platform to respond to potential threats and engineer solutions that amend security flaws.

On November 8th I am invited to present my research and development at an exposition. Here is a copy of the poster I have made that briefly outlines the project.

I am glad to announce that the program I have created is available to configure and use on <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/communityWebcrawler/">Fedora Hosted.</a>

Thanks for reading, and take care.
