An area of Security that I really want to build my skill in is Web Application testing. I've decided that over the course of this week I'm going to watch these excellent video's on <a href="http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/web-pen-testing-workshop">irongeek</a> created by Jeremy Druin, Conrad Reynolds and Adrian Crenshaw. After that I'll be creating some various attack scenarios in Mutillidae which is an intentionally vulnerable web application.
