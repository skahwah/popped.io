It's been some time since my last post so I thought I would share a quick update of what I'm up to.

Recently I've been working on the registration process for the Cracking the Perimeter (CTP) course provided by Offensive Security.

Prior to registering for the CTP course, students are required to complete a set of challenges that establish the minimum required knowledge to partake in the course. I'm about 80% of the way through the challenge, but I found myself stuck on an area which requires a good understanding of assembly and disassembling.

Instead of finding a solution for the current problem, I've decided to invest some time in learning assembly and reverse engineering from the ground up.

Some of the resources I have been using that have helped are:

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Art-Exploitation-Jon-Erickson/dp/1593271441?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=hacking%20art%20of%20exploitation&amp;qid=1465484151&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">Hacking: The Art of Exploitation (2nd Edition)</a><br>
<a href="http://www.securitytube.net/video/208">SecurityTube Assembly Primer for Hackers

Feel free to suggest other resources that can help people prepare for the CTP course in the comments below.
