Popular wordlists such as Rockyou and Uniq are great when used with a variety of rules and big hash sets. But what about the hashes that you aren't able to crack? And what about those users with a base word not found in a standard dictionary?

Queue Wordsmith, a tool that creates wordlists that are tailored to the target’s location. We’ve parsed and analyzed several geographic databases to find road names, cities, counties, landmarks, sports teams, and more for regions all around the world. Built using a modular framework and hosted on GitHub, Wordsmith’s database can easily be updated by anyone with a text editor and an interest in geolocation or spatial databases. With data from 249 countries and territories, Wordsmith can bolster typical dictionaries by adding the name of that unique street that a person grew up on, or by appending a region’s postal codes, all so you crack those hard-to-get hashes.
