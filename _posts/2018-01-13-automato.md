automato uses native LDAP libraries to automate the collection and enumeration of various directory objects. This is incredibly useful during an internal penetration test.

automato can also conduct password spraying attacks, and identify if a user is a local administrator against any number of systems.

Output files are automatically created for evidence preservation.
