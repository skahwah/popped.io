I'm a NYC based [Senior Managing Security Consultant]() on the [IBM X-Force Red Adversary Services](https://www.ibm.com/services/adversary-simulation) team. I mostly focus on long-term adversarial simulations for major organizations and internal strategy. I turned my hobby into a full-time job and love it!

In my free time, you can find me [running](https://results.nyrr.org/runner/43306392/races) around NYC, watching Arsenal kick a ball, or hanging with my family.
